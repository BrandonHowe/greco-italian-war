## Events

* 4/6 - The German armies invaded Greece, while the Luftwaffe bombed Belgrade. The XL Panzer Corps pushed across the Bulgarian border into Yugoslavia at 2 points.
* 4/7 - Yugoslav counter-attack against the division's northern flank was repelled, and then the 2P went across the mountains and overran the Greek 19M.
* 4/8 - German 73I captured Prilep, severing a rail line between Belgrade and Thessaloniki. The XXX Infantry Corp reached its designated objective where the 164I captured Xanthi. 50I advanced far beyong Komotini towards the Nestos river.
* 4/9 - Stumme deployed his forces north of Monastir, in preparation for an attack towards Florina. This position threatened to encircle the Greeks in Albania and W force in the area of Florina, Edessa, and Katerini. The German 9P drove west to link up with the Italians in Albania.
* 4/10 - First contact with Allied troops at Vevi was made.
* 4/11 - German SS units seized Vevi.
* 4/14 - Spearheads of 9P reached Kozani. It established a bridgehead across the Haliacmon river but was stopped. 9P was stopped by the New Zealander 4th and 6th brigades, and the 16th Australian brigade.
* 4/15 - A German motorcycle battalion supported by a tank battalion attacked the ridge, but the Germans were stopped by the NZ 21st battalion. The New Zealanders found themselves enveloped on both sides after the Italian 9th Army took Korca, and the British were forced to abandon the position, leading to the capture of 20000 Greek troops.
* As the Germans invaded deep into Greece, the Epirus Army Section of Greece in Albania was reluctant to retreat. By the middle of March, the British estimated that it was fast approaching the end of its logistical tether.
* 4/13 - The first Greek elements withdrew towards the Pindus mountains. The Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade was assigned to cut off the army's line of retreat by driving westward to the Metsovon psas and from there to Ionnina. The Greek 20I covered the withdraw and delayed the advance by almost a day.
* 4/14 - Several Greek units had reached Grevena. 13I and C did not have the necessary equipment to fight against an armored unit.
* 4/15 - The Greek units were encircled.
* 4/16 - The Germans realized that the British were evacuating troops at Volos and Piraeus. 2P, 5P, and the 1st SS Motorized and both mountain divisons launched a pursuit.
* 4/21 - The Germans advanced further and captured Ioannina, the final supply route of the Greek Epirus Army. 
* 4/23 - The 19th Australian and 6th NZ brigades were decided to hold the Thermopalye passes as long as possible so all the other units could withdraw.
* 4/24 - The Germans attacked, meeting fierce resistance.
* 4/25 - The Germans staged an airborne operation to seize bridges over the Corinth Canal, with the double aim of cutting off the British line of retreat and securing their own way across the isthmus. It was met with success until a British shell destroyed the bridge. The 1st SS Motorized assembled at Ioannina, thrust along the western foothills of the Pindus Mountains via Arta to Missolonghi and crossed over the Peloponnese at Patras. 
* 4/27 - After the Thermopylae area was abandoned, the British withdrew to a position south of Thebes, where they erected a last obstacle in front of Athens. The motorcycle battalion of the 2nd Panzer Division was given the mission of outflanking the British, and meeting little resistance, entered Athens.
* 4/30 - The evacuation of nearly 50000 soldiers was completed.

## Other details

* The Greek campaign ended with a compelte German and Italian victory. The British could not carry out both a Balkan and African campaign. There were many other reasons why the Axis won, which include:
* German superiority in ground forces and equipment
* Most of the Greek troops were sent to fight in Albania.
* The Germans had air superiority and the Greeks could not provide the RAF with adequate airfiends
* The British expeditionary forces were weak
* The Hellinic Army was in poor condition and had many shortages of modern equipment
* Inadequate infrastructure (ports, roads, rails)
* Lack of coordination between UK, Greece, and Yugoslavia
* Turkey's strict neutrality
* The early collapse of Yugoslavia.
