## Events

* 3/9 - Heavy bombardment of Greek positions by artillery and aircraft.
* 3/9 to 3/10 - Greek positions held.
* 3/9 to 3/24 - Hill 731.
* Although it failed, the Spring Offensive further exhausted the Greek army which had been fighting a larger power continuously for 6 months. The Greeks only had about a month left of heavy artillery ammunition, and they had insufficient supplies to equip its reserves. They asked the British for millions of artillery shells and tens of millions of rifle rounds, however, this proved to be a logistical impossibility.

## Other details

* Mussolini admitted that the result of the offensive was zero.
* The Italians took nearly 12000 casualties, while the Greeks only suffered about 5000.
* The Greeks were fast approaching the end of their logistical tether. By the end of March, the Greeks only had a month's supply of artillery ammunition. The Italians still had lots of men and materials left. The Greek divisions were stretched thin as they wanted to not cede any ground to the Italians. The British stepped up their aid and sent more resources, however the Greeks did not consider this sufficient for winning the war.
