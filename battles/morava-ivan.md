## Events

* 11/13 - 9I, 10I, and 15I were all concentrated for the attack. 11I and 13I were on the march to reinforce the Greek forces.
* It was a decisive Greek victory, with the Greek army capturing Korce, Argyrokastro, Pogradec, and Moscopole.

## Other details

* The Greek plan was to put the main effort on the left, along the mountainous road through the village Darza, rather through the Cangonj pass, as there were fears that the Italians could use armour through the relatively flat terrain of the Cangonj pass. The Greeks would attack with the 15th Division on the right (toward Cangonj), the 9th in the centre and the 10th on the left. The 15th had the task of approaching the Cangonj pass, between Ivan and Morava, and capturing if possible its western exit. The 9th would attack toward the Morava mountain, coordinating its left flank with the 10th Division. The 10th Division had the task of penetrating the Italian position, through the use of surprise, and if possible flank the Italian positions atop of Morava.
