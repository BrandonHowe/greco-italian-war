* The only Greek division covering that area was the 8th Infantry Division. However, the commander knew that the Italian superiority in men and armor was limited because of the mountains and marshy terrain.

* The Greek screening units started a slow retreat towards the main defensive line of Elaia-Kalamas, about 30 km south of the Greek-Albanian border, north of Ioannina.

* 11/2 - Greek forces were positioned according to the defensive paln in the line: Kalamas - Elaia - Grabala - Kleftis hill. The Italian army launched air and artillery strikes, however 23I was unsuccessful in attacking the Greeks.

* 11/3 - The Italians faced many issues with the terrain. 131A's tankettes and medium tanks were unable to cope with the hilly terrain and muddy ground, and were unable to breach the Greek defensive line.

* 11/5 - The Littoral Group made a slow advance along the coast and was able to secure a bridgehead over the Kalamas River.

* 11/8 - The Italian offensive was suspended.
