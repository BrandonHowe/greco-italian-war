## Events

* After the Battle of Morava-Ivan, the Hellinic Army went deep into Albania. To secure the Greek positions, it was decided that they would take the Klisura Pass.
* 1/6 - The attack was led by 1I and 11I. The Greeks decimated 131A with artillery fire.
* 1/10 - Greek infantry divisions capture the pass. 5I was part of the final assault that captured the pass.
* The Italians immediately launched counterattacks. 7I supported 3Al in taking back the pass, however the operation was not well prepared, and it failed.
* 1/11 - The Italians had been pushed back and 7I was almost destroyed, securing Greek posession of the pass.

## Other details

* Even though their successes were rapid, the Greeks had much larger distances to deal with and their road network was much more inferior.
* In the following weeks, the front line stabilized, as the Greeks had to deal with their logistical situation and the Italians managed to gain enough numerical superiority to stop retreating.
